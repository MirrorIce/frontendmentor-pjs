## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Live Site URL: https://mirrorice.github.io/frontendmentor-pjs/social-links-profile/index.html"

## My process
The most important part for me is to determine the structure of the website. Based on that, the rest of the styling flows naturally, so the emphasis is put on how to separate the elements/concerns. After that, I'm building the layout and see how it's going to take shape and only afterwards I'm going for the individual elements' styling (buttons, colors, paddings, etc).
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
