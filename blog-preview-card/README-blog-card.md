## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

More practice on how to structure the html page. This is the most useful step to do, since the styling is going to naturally fall into place. 

### Continued development

Getting used to frontendmentor's workflow and the challenges is the current priority, for now.
